## Get Started

## Developer Setup Guide
Make sure to install:
- [Go](https://go.dev/)

The project is based on Go and React. I use [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/go/) as IDE and included my project
configurations within this file, which might save you some time getting started with the project in case you do not
prefer another IDE.
